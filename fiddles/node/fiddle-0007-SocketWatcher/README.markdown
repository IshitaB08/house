[Issue 16](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/16)

### Description

POC exploring how to create a unix socket based file watcher. When the target file changes, any telnet sessions 
subscribed to the server's unix socket are notified.  Note, this POC is based on the _unix socket_ example given in 
Chapter 3 of Jim R. Wilson's book [Node.js the Right Way](https://pragprog.com/book/jwnode/node-js-the-right-way).
