[Issue 335](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/335)


### Description <a name="description"></a>

`Get Webpack?` A little. But ... `riddle me a another fiddle` based on the [webpack guide pages](https://webpack.js.org/guides). For this second fiddle, which builds on [node fiddle #43 - WebPackHW](../fiddle-0043-WebPackHW), go through the second two guides -- 

*   [Output Management](https://webpack.js.org/guides/output-management/)
*   [Development](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/)

These guides build on one another and illustrate how to configure webpack--

*   split output files
*   set the "mode" option
*   generate an index.html file
*   clean the build directory
*   configure javascript source file mapping
*   automatically re-bundle files on file change -- aka "watch"

Using the [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin), [clean-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clean-webpack-plugin), and [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server). 


### Use Case<a name="use-case"></a>

1.  Open a console and navigate to the fiddle's root directory
2.  Enter the command `npm install`
3.  Run `npm run server`
