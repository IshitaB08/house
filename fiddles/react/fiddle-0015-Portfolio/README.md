### Issue

[Issue 300](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/300)


### Description

Recently I met a young developer who was looking for a job at a startup.  The developer had experience with React but 
had never worked with bootstrap.  So I of course thought:  `Oh boy, a react fiddle.`  And here we go.  The idea is 
that the developer needs to show some knowledge of coding while at the same time keeping it simple and extendable.
