### Issue

[Issue 279](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/279)


### Description

Okay, google authentication down, next problem:  navigation.  If you launch Chrome on your phone it provides a bottom 
nav bar as well as swipe support. Swipe left to go back.  Swipe right to go forward.  Gesture events are easy enough, 
but the bottom bar is a question mark.  I need that...  `Riddle me a fiddle`.


### Pre-Requisite

*   A Mac loaded XCode and NativeScript
*   iOS Test Device or simulator


### Use Case

1.  On your test device install `NativeScript Playground` and `NativeScript Preview`
2.  Using your terminal app of choice, complete the [Bash Setup Procedure](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/wiki/Setup-(Mac-OS))
3.  Startup the POC `fiddle start nativescript 0017`
4.  On your test device, launch `NativeScript Playground`
5.  Scan the QR Code visible in the terminal output (3)
