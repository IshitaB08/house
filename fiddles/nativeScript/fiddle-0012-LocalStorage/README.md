### Title

Local Storage Plugin


### Creation Date

### Location

Chicago, IL


### Issue

[Issue 189](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/189)


### Description

Simple fiddle exploring how to use the [nativescript-localstorage plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-localstorage) 
to save and restore application state on an android device.  

Note - I need to know if this plugin can be used as an alternative to sqlite3 to manage Application State.  
If the plugin provides a similar  interface to local storage in the browser, then I have an answer to managing
state in [Puzzle 16](https://github.com/bradyhouse/16). 


### Use Case

1.  Using your terminal app of choice navigate to the `scripts` directory
2.  Startup the POC `fiddle.sh start fiddle-0012-LocalStorage`
