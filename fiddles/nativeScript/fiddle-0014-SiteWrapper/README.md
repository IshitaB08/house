### Issue

[Issue 265](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/265)


### Description

Given a website designed to look good on mobile devices, can nativeScript be used to create a simple App wrapper?  
In other words, can I create an App that simply opens the website?  It's been a while since I have added to the 
NativeScript fiddle collection.  So this should be interesting...


### Use Case

1.  Using your terminal app of choice
2.  Startup the POC by entering the command `fiddle start 0014`
3.  On your test device (iphone / android), launch the `NativeScript Playground` App
4.  Scan the QR Code displayed in the terminal window output (2)
