== Android Studio Setup (Mac OS X)

In order to build native Android apps, the best IDE is Android Studio. In addition, it provides easy access to the GUI
versions of Android SDK and AVD Managers. The Studio bundle for Mac OS X can be downloaded from
link:https://developer.android.com/studio/[developer.android.com/studio].


== Android Commandline Setup (Mac OS X)

In order to run android based fiddles, android commandline tools need to be setup. The following procedure outlines the step necessary to complete this process.


1.  Install Homebrew:

    `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

2.  Install Java8:

    `brew tap caskroom/versions`
    `brew cask install java8`

3.  Set the JAVA_HOME system environment variable in your .zshrc (and/or) .bash_profile files:

    `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)`

4.  Launch Android Studio

8.  Under `Configure` open `SDK Manager` 

9.  In the SDK Manager > SDK Platforms tab, select and install the latest version of android

10. Use the SDK Path, <<SDK PATH>>, visible in the SDK Manager to set the following ANDROID_* system variables in your .zshrc (and/or) .bash_profile files:

    `
    ### ANDROID
    export ANDROID_HOME=<<SDK PATH>>;
    export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME;
    export ANDROID_SDK_HOME=/Users/<<USER NAM>>/.android;
    export ANDROID_AVD_HOME=$ANDROID_SDK_HOME/avd;
    export PATH=$PATH:"$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/tools/bin";
    `	    
    	
11. Go to the SDK Tools tab, select and install the following:
      
      `
      * Google Play services
      * GPU Debugging tools
      * Android Auto Desktop Head Unit emulator
      * Google Play Licensing Library
      * Google Play Instant Development SDK
      * Android Auto API Simulators
      * CMake
      * Google Web Driver
      * NDK
      * LLDB
      * Documentation for Android SDK
      * Solver for ConstraintLayout
      * Google Play APK Expansion library
      * ConstraintLayout
      `
      
12. Under `Configure` open `AVD Manager` 

13. Using AVD Manager, create an Android Virtual Device that supports `Google Play`. The device should be called `fiddler`

15. Verify that you can startup the `fiddler` virtual device
